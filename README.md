Throttling in JavaScript

let us consider a situation where a function or an api is called multiple times and by user which is not specified that how many times it is called. 

So in that case if user calls it multiple times more than required times. Then it will put load on website.

To solve the problem, concept of throttling is used in which the function call or api call in made at a reqular interval.

In technical terms throttling can be defined as technique used to limit the call rate of a function or api call. It ensures that the function call is made at reqular intervals regardless of how many times it is called.
