Datatype in JavaScript

Data type refers to the type of data that a JavaScript variable can hold. 

There are seven primitive data types in JavaScript 
1. Number
2. BigInt
3. String
4. Boolean
5. Null
6. Undefined 
7. Symbol. 

Objects are non-primitives.

Objects

JavaScript object is a data structure that allows us to have key-value pairs; so we can have distinct keys and each key is mapped to a value that can be of any JavaScript data type. Comparing it to a real-world object, a pen is an object with several properties such as color, design, the material it is made of, etc. In the same way, JavaScript objects can have properties that define their characteristics.

The object data type can contain:

1. An object
2. An array
3. A date
