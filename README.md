Debouncing in JavaScript

let us consider a situation where a function or an api is called multiple times and by user which is not specified that how many times it is called. 

So in that case if user calls it multiple times more than required times. Then it will put load on website.

To solve the problem, concept of Debouncing is used in which the function call or api call in made after the input by user is stopped for a required interval.

In technical terms Debouncing can be defined as the technique of delaying the execution of a function until a certain period of time has passed since the last time the function was invoked.
