Variables in JavaScript

1. [var] keyword
    The var statement declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

2. [let] keyword
    The let declaration declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

3. [const] keyword
    Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the let keyword. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment (i.e. by using the assignment operator), and it can't be redeclared (i.e. through a variable declaration). However, if a constant is an object or array its properties or items can be updated or removed.

Variable Declarations
To use variables in JavaScript, we first need to create it i.e. declare a variable. To declare variables, we use one of the var, let, or const keywords.

Hoisting
JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables, or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

Scopes
In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of a variable or how it can be used after it is declared. The scope of a variable depends on the keyword that was used to declare it.

There are three scopes 
    1. Global Scope
    2. Function Scope
    3. Block Scope
