Variables in JavaScript

1. [var] keyword
    The var statement declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

2. [let] keyword
    The let declaration declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

3. [const] keyword
    Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the let keyword. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment (i.e. by using the assignment operator), and it can't be redeclared (i.e. through a variable declaration). However, if a constant is an object or array its properties or items can be updated or removed.
