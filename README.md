# Module Pattern in JavaScript

The module pattern in JavaScript is a design pattern that allows for the creation of public and private methods and variables within an object, effectively acting as a self-contained component. This is achieved through the use of closure, which creates a private scope for the object and its methods.

## There are two main methods to create module pattern.
1. Using Object Literal Notation
2. Using IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)
