Call()
Using the call method, we can invoke a function, by passing a value that will be treated as this inside it.

apply()
apply() and call() are very similar the only difference is the way of passing the argument.
In call() the arguement is passed normally after the first argument viz for this keyword, but in apply()
the argument are passed in the form of array.

bind()
this method only changes the this value in the function it does not return the function.
