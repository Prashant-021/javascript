Functions in JavaScript

Functions are the block of code to perform particulat task.
They execute when they are called or invoked. 
To define and declare the function first type "function" keyword followed by function name and then "()" for parameters and arguement. After that in {} bracket statements are present in which required calculation is done

Syntax:- 
function name(param1, param2){
    // Code
}

function returns a value, if return statement is not used in function then it returns 'undefined by default'


Anonymous functions are the function without name.
They are used when we want a value i.e., when you want to asign value to some variable


First Class functions 
The ability of functions to be used as values and can be passed as argument to another function and return from  function.

Arrow Function
// Arrow functions are not hoisted. They must be defined before they are used.

// using const instead of var is safer option as function expression is always constant value
